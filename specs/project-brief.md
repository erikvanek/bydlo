# Project Context: Design Consultation Matchmaking Platform

## What This Is

A matchmaking platform that connects people going through **transitional living situations** with **freelance interior designers and architects** for short, focused consultations. Not full renovation projects. Not big studio contracts. Small, accessible engagements — a few hours of professional guidance at a critical moment.

The core insight is that most people don't know they need design help until they're already overwhelmed by a situation that a professional could resolve in an hour or two. The platform surfaces that need and makes acting on it feel easy and affordable.

## The Problem We're Validating

People move, merge households, and renovate all the time. They fight about furniture, waste money on things that don't fit, and end up with spaces that feel wrong. A trained designer or architect could resolve most of these problems quickly — but the market for design services is framed around big projects, long contracts, and high budgets. There's no accessible, low-commitment way to get professional design guidance for everyday situations.

At the same time, many freelance designers and architects have capacity for smaller engagements but no channel to reach people who would benefit from them.

## Target Clients (Demand Side)

Three main groups have been identified, listed by current signal strength:

**1. Students moving into shared flats**
Typically moving from their home city to a university city, or from their first shared flat to another. Often moving in with strangers or acquaintances. Budget is tight, but the need to make a shared space livable — especially around storage, layout, and managing conflicting styles between flatmates — is real. The hypothesis is that even students might spend a small amount on a single consultation that prevents months of friction.

**2. Couples moving in together**
Two people with their own furniture, their own aesthetic preferences, and their own emotional attachments to their stuff. Moving in together is often the first moment they realize they have conflicting design instincts. Fights about what to keep, what to sell, how to arrange things, how to make the space feel like "theirs" rather than one person's. A consultation here has clear value — it's neutral professional arbitration as much as design guidance.

**3. Small-scale renovations**
Someone wants to redo one room. Maybe a bathroom, a kitchen, a living room. Not a whole flat, not a construction project — just a focused, bounded change. Currently there's no obvious way to hire an architect or designer for something this small without it feeling disproportionately complex and expensive.

## The Suppliers (Supply Side)

Freelance architects and interior designers who want shorter, more varied engagements. The assumption is that many capable professionals have capacity for consultation-style work but currently have no channel to reach people who need it at this scale. The platform needs to make them discoverable and the engagement format feel legitimate and worthwhile.

The supply side is not the current focus. We have some informal signals that designers would participate, but the primary discovery effort is on the demand side.

## Where the Idea Stands

Early-stage. The core hypothesis has **weak but present signals** — there's intuition and some informal validation that the need exists, but no strong market evidence yet. The immediate priority is **demand-side discovery**: talking to real potential clients to understand whether they recognize the problem, whether they'd pay for a solution, and what the service would need to look and feel like.

This is lean product discovery. The goal is to validate, invalidate, or pivot quickly — not to build a complete product. The project should be run with that mentality: assumptions made explicit, learning prioritized over shipping, willingness to change direction based on what users actually say.

## The Discovery Approach

Qualitative interviews are the primary research method. The plan is to speak with people in or near one of the three target situations. Interviews will have two halves:

**First half:** Open-ended conversation. Understand their situation, what was hard about it, what they did about it, what they wish had existed.

**Second half:** Introduce the concept using a prototype as a boundary object. "Here's how something like this could look — what's your reaction?" This is where the prototype earns its value — not as a demo of a finished product, but as a stimulus to get concrete feedback on form, framing, and value proposition.

## The Prototype

A clickable prototype is being built specifically for the second half of these interviews. It needs to be:
- Real enough to feel credible
- Simple enough to explain in 30 seconds
- Complete enough that users can navigate it and form opinions

The prototype focuses on two user journeys:

**Journey 1 (primary): Describe your situation.** The user writes a few sentences about what's going on — "My partner and I are moving in together next month, we both have furniture and no idea how to make it work in a smaller flat." An AI-driven conversation follows: 2-4 follow-up questions to understand budget, timeline, priorities. The result is a ranked list of matched designers.

**Journey 2: Choose a consultant.** Skip the matching conversation and browse all available designers directly. Filter by specialty, location, availability, and rate.

Both journeys end at a designer profile page and a simulated "book a consultation" button — which, in the prototype, just tells users they've reached the end and this is where a real booking would happen.

The AI conversation in Journey 1 is intentional and meaningful to the product concept — not a gimmick. The hypothesis is that describing your situation in natural language, and having it understood and acted on, is a significantly better experience than filling in a form. This is one of the things the discovery interviews are designed to test.

## Geography

Initial scope is **Czech Republic**, with designers in Prague (primary), Brno, Olomouc, and Ostrava. The platform is designed with Czech users in mind, but nothing about the concept is geographically constrained long-term.

## Rates and Format

Designer consultations are priced by the hour, roughly €40-120/hour depending on experience and specialty. The platform is not trying to compete on price — it's making the *existence* of this kind of consultation accessible to people who don't know they can get it.

## What We Don't Know Yet (Key Assumptions to Validate)

- Do people in these situations recognize that a designer could help them?
- Would they pay for a short consultation, or does "design" feel like something only relevant to bigger projects?
- What's the right framing? (Is "consultation" the right word? Is "designer" or "architect" the right category?)
- Does the AI-conversation matching feel helpful or strange?
- Is the platform model right, or would people prefer a different format (e.g., just a curated directory, or a fixed-price package)?
- Are students actually a viable segment, or is the price sensitivity too high?

## How to Work With This Project

This project is being run as **lean discovery** — the goal at every stage is to learn fast and stay open to changing direction. When working on this project, the right posture is:

- **Validate before building.** If a feature is untested, treat it as an assumption, not a requirement.
- **Prototype to learn, not to ship.** The current prototype exists to generate interview stimulus, not to become a product.
- **Prioritize learning artifacts over finished features.** A rough version that can be tested is more valuable than a polished version that can't.
- **Make assumptions explicit.** When proposing something — a flow, a feature, a frame — name the assumption underneath it so it can be tested.
- **Stay close to the problem.** The three target situations (students, couples, renovations) are real and specific. Keep recommendations grounded in those scenarios.

The person running this project has a background in product design, service design, and engineering. They're comfortable with technical depth and don't need things simplified — but they do want the thinking to stay connected to real users and real situations, not just product or technical abstractions.
