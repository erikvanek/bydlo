    shortBio: 'I spent six years designing hotel rooms before realising the spaces I actually cared about were the small, real ones — the 35 m\u00B2 flat where a couple is figuring out how to fit two desks and still have a living room. That\'s my thing. I\'ve helped over 80 clients in Prague turn tight layouts into places that genuinely work for how they live, not how a catalogue says they should.',
    approach: 'We start with a 20-minute video call where I ask you to walk me through your space on camera — I want to see the awkward corners and the light at different times of day. Within three days you get a floor plan with two layout options, a simple mood board, and a prioritised shopping list with links and prices. Everything is designed so you can execute it yourself over a weekend. If you get stuck, I offer a follow-up call at no extra charge.',

    shortBio: 'Twelve years ago I started my career on large commercial projects. Interesting work, but I kept coming home to my own cramped Prague flat and thinking: why doesn\'t anyone bring this level of care to normal apartments? Now I exclusively do small-scale residential — kitchen tear-outs, bathroom reconfiguration, opening up a living space by moving a single wall. I know Prague building regs inside out and I\'ve built relationships with reliable contractors who won\'t ghost you mid-project.',
    approach: 'I do a site visit first — usually 45 minutes, measuring everything and photographing the details that matter (pipes, load-bearing walls, electrical panels). You then get a clear written brief within a week: what\'s possible, what it\'ll roughly cost, and a timeline. If you decide to go ahead, I produce proper drawings your contractor can build from. I stay involved during construction with weekly check-ins so nothing drifts off plan.',

    shortBio: 'Moving in together is exciting and chaotic in equal measure. I specialise in exactly that moment — when two people with different tastes, different furniture, and different ideas of what "cosy" means need to create one shared home. I studied architecture at UMPRUM and then shifted to interiors because I wanted to work closer to how people actually live. Most of my clients are couples in their late 20s and 30s navigating their first shared space.',
    approach: 'We begin with a conversation — ideally with both of you — where I map out your non-negotiables, guilty pleasures, and the things you\'re flexible on. I then propose two to three direction concepts: colour palette, key furniture pieces, and layout. You pick a direction and I refine it into a concrete plan with a room-by-room guide you can implement at your own pace. The whole process takes about two weeks and is designed for people who want guidance, not a full hand-holding service.',

    shortBio: 'I\'m not going to pretend I have decades of experience — I\'ve been doing this for three years. But I\'ve furnished and laid out over 40 student and first-timer flats in that time, and I genuinely believe you don\'t need a big budget to have a space that feels intentional. I\'m obsessed with getting the most out of IKEA, Marketplace finds, and clever DIY. If your budget is under \u20AC1,500 for a whole room, I\'m your person.',
    approach: 'One 90-minute session, either in person or over video. I measure the space, we talk through your daily routines (where do you eat, work, hang out?), and I sketch options on the spot. Within 48 hours you get a floor plan, a shopping list with exact product links and costs, and a short guide on assembly order. Average total spend for my clients: \u20AC800\u2013\u20AC1,200 for a complete room makeover. I also share a discount code for a local furniture delivery service.',

    shortBio: 'Colour changes everything. A room can have perfect furniture and still feel wrong because the walls, textiles, and lighting aren\'t talking to each other. I\'ve spent ten years developing an eye for material palettes — which wood tones work with which fabrics, how a single accent wall can make a 30 m\u00B2 flat feel twice its size. I trained in textile design before moving to interiors, and that background shows in every project.',
    approach: 'I work in a structured way: first a detailed questionnaire about your preferences, then an in-person visit where I bring physical samples — fabric swatches, paint chips, material tiles. You get to touch and see things in your actual light. The deliverable is a comprehensive mood board with specific product recommendations, a colour map for every room, and a 10-page PDF you can reference whenever you\'re making a purchase decision. Most clients tell me they still use it two years later.',

They\'re the Prague 7 kitchen that went from unusable to the heart of the home, the Vinohrady bathroom that finally got proper ventilation, the Žižkov one-bedroom where we gained 6 m\u00B2 of usable space by rethinking one wall. I charge more than some, but my clients save money overall because the plan is right the first time.',
    approach: 'We start with a thorough site assessment — I measure everything, check structural elements, and note what\'s fixable vs. what you\'re stuck with. You get a realistic written scope within five days: what I recommend, what it\'ll cost, and what the timeline looks like. If you green-light it, I produce construction drawings, a material specification, and I\'ll even sit in on your first meeting with the contractor to make sure everyone\'s aligned. No surprises, no scope creep.',

I\'m the person you call when you\'ve just signed a lease, you\'re standing in an empty room, and you have no idea where to start. I\'m young, I\'m affordable, and I genuinely get excited about turning a blank space into somewhere you want to come home to.',
    approach: 'Super relaxed process. We grab a coffee (my treat) and you show me photos of your place or I come over. I ask a bunch of questions about how you live — are you a cook-every-night person or a takeaway person? Do you work from home? Do you have people over? Then I put together a visual plan: layout, key pieces, colour suggestions, and where to buy everything on a budget. Delivered as a shareable Pinterest-style board plus a simple floor plan sketch. Usually done within a week.',

    shortBio: 'I bridge the gap between architecture and interior design because most residential projects need both. Knocking down a wall is an architectural decision; choosing what goes in the new open space is an interior one. I do both, which means one person, one vision, no miscommunication. I\'ve completed over 50 flat renovations across Brno, from full gut-jobs in panelák buildings to light refreshes of turn-of-the-century apartments.',
    approach: 'Step one: a free 30-minute intro call to see if we\'re a good fit. If we are, I do a site visit with full measurements and a structural assessment. Within ten days you receive a comprehensive proposal: floor plan options, a 3D visualisation of the key room, material palette, and a cost estimate broken into phases so you can tackle it gradually if budget is tight. I coordinate directly with contractors I trust and stay hands-on until the last shelf is mounted.',

I work with first-time renters, young couples, and anyone who wants their space to feel considered but doesn\'t have an unlimited budget. I\'m practical first, aesthetic second — but the best part is, when the practical stuff is right, the space just looks better naturally.',
    approach: 'We meet for one focused session — about two hours, either at your place or over video with a good phone tour. I ask detailed questions about your routines, pain points, and what "home" means to you. You get a written plan within five days: annotated floor plan, a mood direction, specific product recommendations across three price tiers (budget, mid, splurge), and a room-by-room priority list so you know what to tackle first. It\'s designed to be actionable, not aspirational.',

Eleven years of residential work in Brno has given me deep knowledge of local regulations, common structural systems in Czech housing stock, and which contractors actually show up on time. I specialise in renovations that involve structural changes: moving walls, reconfiguring bathrooms, opening up kitchens. The stuff that scares people, but transforms spaces.',
    approach: 'Initial site visit to assess the space and discuss your goals — this is free and takes about an hour. If the project makes sense, I prepare a feasibility study: what\'s structurally possible, what needs permits, and a rough cost range. Once you approve the direction, I deliver full technical drawings, handle permit applications if needed, and provide a detailed contractor brief. I also offer construction supervision as an add-on — I visit the site weekly and flag issues before they become expensive problems.',

    approach: 'Everything starts with listening. I visit your space (or we do a detailed video walkthrough) and I want to hear what you love about it, what frustrates you, and what pieces of furniture you\'re attached to — because good design works with what you have, not against it. I deliver a room-by-room plan with annotated photos of your actual space, showing exactly what goes where. Plus a curated shopping list from local Olomouc shops and online stores, with alternatives at different price points.',

Tier three: complete project management including contractor coordination, site visits, and final styling (\u20AC800+).

My clients tend to be people who\'ve bought something with potential and need someone to help them see it and execute it properly.',

You receive a detailed assessment document within a week: what\'s possible, what I\'d recommend, and cost estimates for each phase. For renovation projects, I produce full architectural drawings, handle building permit applications, and provide a contractor tender package so you can get comparable quotes. I stay involved through construction with bi-weekly site inspections and a punch list before handover.',

    shortBio: 'I used to work in set design for Czech Television, and it completely changed how I think about interiors. On a set, every object tells a story and every corner is considered — I bring that same intentionality to real homes. I work with people who want their flat to have character and narrative, not just look like a page from a catalogue. Most of my clients find me through Instagram, where I share before-and-afters from Prague apartments.',
    approach: 'I do things visually from day one. Before our first meeting, I ask you to send me 10 photos of spaces you love — any spaces, not just interiors. It tells me more than any questionnaire. Then we meet at your place, I take my own photos and measurements, and within a week you get a visual concept deck: mood, palette, layout, and key pieces. I also include a "don\'t buy" list — things people waste money on that never work. It\'s the part clients remember most.',

    shortBio: 'I focus on one thing: making kitchens and bathrooms work. These are the two rooms where bad design costs you the most — in daily frustration, in wasted space, and in money if you get the renovation wrong. After eight years and over 60 kitchen and bathroom projects across Prague, I\'ve seen every mistake in the book and I know how to avoid them. If you\'re planning a wet-room renovation, I\'m probably the most specialised person you\'ll find at this price point.',
    approach: 'Kitchen and bathroom projects are technical, so I\'m thorough upfront. Site visit with full measurements including plumbing positions, electrical points, and ventilation. Within a week you get a detailed layout with appliance placement, a materials specification with three price options, and a realistic cost breakdown. I also provide a contractor checklist — the exact questions to ask and red flags to watch for. If you want, I\'ll review contractor quotes for a flat fee before you commit.',

    shortBio: 'I work at the intersection of sustainability and beautiful living. Before starting my own practice, I spent three years at a passive-house architecture studio, which gave me a deep understanding of materials, energy efficiency, and indoor air quality. Now I apply that thinking to normal flats — choosing materials that are healthy, durable, and look good ten years from now, not just on moving day. I believe sustainable design and good design are the same thing.',
    approach: 'My process starts with understanding your space and your values. We discuss materials, longevity, and budget in the first session. I then develop a comprehensive interior concept that prioritises natural materials, good light management, and pieces that won\'t end up in a landfill in three years. You receive a detailed material palette with sourcing information, a floor plan, and a phased implementation guide. I also provide a lifecycle cost comparison — sometimes the sustainable choice is actually cheaper over five years.',

    shortBio: 'I\'m a workspace specialist. With remote work becoming the norm, most people I work with need their flat to function as both a home and an office — and those two things fight each other constantly. Where does the desk go? How do you separate work from rest in 45 m\u00B2? I\'ve solved this problem over 30 times now, and I have a toolkit of solutions that range from simple furniture rearrangement to custom-built room dividers that cost less than you\'d think.',
    approach: 'We start with a work-habits interview — I need to understand your job before I can design your workspace. Video calls all day? Deep focus work? Standing desk or sitting? Then I visit (or video-tour) your space and identify the best zone for work based on light, noise, and proximity to the kitchen. You get a detailed plan with ergonomic considerations, cable management solutions, and product recommendations. I also include acoustic tips — a rug and some strategic shelving can transform a echoey flat into a focused workspace.',

    shortBio: 'Nine years ago I redesigned my parents\' flat as a birthday gift, they cried, and I realised this was what I wanted to do. Since then I\'ve built a practice around making homes feel emotionally right — not just functionally correct. I pay attention to the soft things: how light moves through a room during the day, what you see first when you walk in, whether the space invites you to slow down or keeps you restless. I work mostly in Brno and occasionally take projects in Bratislava.',
    approach: 'I\'m slower and more deliberate than most designers, and my clients appreciate that. First meeting is a long conversation — two hours minimum — where I learn about your life, not just your floor plan. I visit at different times of day if possible to understand the light. Then I develop one carefully considered concept (not three rushed ones) with a narrative thread that ties the rooms together. Deliverables include a visual presentation, material samples I source personally, and a staged implementation plan so the space evolves naturally rather than being "done" all at once.',

My clients value directness: I tell you what I\'d do, not what I think you want to hear.',
    approach: 'My process is efficient because I\'ve done it hundreds of times. Initial consultation at your place — one hour, free, no obligation. If we decide to work together, you get a phased proposal within a week: Phase 1 is always a layout study with options. Phase 2 is detailed design and material selection. Phase 3 is construction documentation and contractor tendering. You can stop after any phase. Every phase has a fixed price agreed upfront — no hourly billing surprises. I also guarantee a two-week turnaround on each phase.',

But if you love colour, pattern, collected objects, and rooms that feel alive and layered — let\'s talk. I work with people who have too much stuff and feel guilty about it, and I show them how to arrange it so it looks intentional rather than chaotic. Your things tell your story; I just help you display them well.',
    approach: 'First I need to see your stuff — all of it. I visit your flat and we go through what you own together. I sort things into keep, rethink, and release piles (gently, no pressure). Then I create a layout that gives your favourite pieces room to breathe and groups the rest in ways that create visual rhythm instead of clutter. You get a detailed arrangement plan with photos of exactly where things go, plus suggestions for a few key additions — usually vintage or second-hand — that tie everything together.',

I mostly work on partial renovations: opening kitchens, reconfiguring entries, rethinking storage. Small interventions with outsized impact.',
    approach: 'Every project starts with a thorough assessment — I measure, photograph, and sketch on-site. Then I develop a concept that I present as a detailed 3D visualisation so you can see the result before committing. This is where most clients say "yes, that\'s it." From there I produce technical drawings, a bill of quantities for your contractor, and I personally select key materials and finishes. I stay involved through construction with regular site visits. My goal is that the finished space matches the render — and it always does.',

Custom built-ins, clever nooks, furniture that does double duty — that\'s my world.',

You get detailed drawings for custom built-in solutions with millimetre precision, plus a spec sheet your carpenter can work from directly. I partner with two Ostrava carpentry workshops who build to my drawings at fair prices. For bigger projects, I handle the full architectural scope: layout changes, permits, and construction coordination.',

My design solutions are about making communal spaces feel fair, functional, and genuinely pleasant to spend time in, while giving each person enough personal territory to feel at home.',
    approach: 'Ideally I meet all flatmates, but even a conversation with one person gives me a lot to work with. I assess the shared spaces for flow, storage equity, and conflict zones (the kitchen counter that\'s always cluttered, the bathroom with no shelf space). You get a practical reconfiguration plan with zone markings, specific furniture that creates visual separation without walls, and a shared-storage system that gives everyone equal space. I also include house "rules" suggestions — design can solve most flatmate friction, but some things need a conversation.',

At handover, we do a formal walkthrough with a punch list. My fee is a percentage of construction cost — transparent and aligned with your budget.',
